## Technical Implementation

### Backend Integration ⭐ **FIXED**
```typescript
// Now uses real backend data instead of mock data
const openDetailsModal = (branch: BranchResponseDto) => {
  setSelectedBranch(branch);
  setShowDetailsModal(true);
  // No separate API call needed - users are included in branch response
};
```

### Backend User Interface
```typescript
interface BackendUser {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  role: 'BRANCH_MANAGER' | 'BRANCH_APPROVER' | 'SALES_USER' | 'REQUEST_INITIATOR' | 'SUPER_ADMIN' | 'AUDITOR';
  branchId: number;
  branchName: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  enabled: boolean;
  phone?: string;
}
```

### State Management
```typescript
const [showDetailsModal, setShowDetailsModal] = useState(false);
// No separate branchUsers state needed - uses selectedBranch.users directly
```

### Data Source
- **Real Backend Data**: Uses `selectedBranch.users` array from backend response
- **No Mock Data**: Removed dependency on mock API service
- **Type Safety**: Properly typed with `BackendUser` interface
- **Status Mapping**: Maps `enabled` field to Active/Inactive status

### User Card Design
- **Left Side**: Avatar, name, email, phone
- **Right Side**: Role badge and status indicator
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Professional Styling**: Consistent with existing design system

## User Workflow

1. **View Branches**: See all branch cards in the grid
2. **Click Branch**: Click anywhere on a branch card
3. **View Details**: Comprehensive details modal opens with user loading
4. **Browse Users**: Scroll through all branch users with their details
5. **Identify Roles**: See color-coded role badges and status indicators
6. **Quick Edit**: Click "Edit Branch" to switch to edit mode
7. **Close**: Click "Close" or "×" to dismiss modal

## Data Display

## Benefits

2. **Complete User Visibility**: View all users assigned to a branch at a glance
3. **Role Identification**: Quickly identify user roles with color-coded badges
4. **Contact Information**: Access to user email and phone details
5. **Better UX**: Users can quickly view comprehensive branch information
6. **Information Rich**: Complete view of branch structure and personnel
7. **Quick Actions**: Direct transition to edit mode
8. **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design works on all devices
9. **Professional**: Clean, modern modal design with user cards
10. **Efficient**: Uses data already included in branch response (no additional API calls)
11. **Status Awareness**: Clear indication of user enabled/disabled status
12. **Type Safety**: Properly typed interfaces prevent runtime errors

## API Integration

### User Data Source
- Uses existing `apiService.getUsers()` method
- Filters users by `branchId` field
- Handles loading states and error scenarios
- Provides real-time user information

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Users are only fetched when modal opens
- **Caching**: User data is stored in component state during modal session
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to empty state on API errors
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during data fetching

The enhanced feature provides a complete view of branch operations including detailed user management, making it easier for administrators to understand branch structure, personnel, and capabilities at a glance.
